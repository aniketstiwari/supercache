# Supercache

Supercache is a totally unobtrusive addon that runs along your Rails application rapidly improving your development time by caching ActiveRecord Queries across requests (unlike ActiveRecord QueryCache which happens only within a single request). This is especially helpful when your local database is located elsewhere and avoids costly DNS lookups for each and every query.

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'supercache'
```

And mount the dashboard in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Supercache::Engine, at: "supercache"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
